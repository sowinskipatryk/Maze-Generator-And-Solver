A simple maze generator and solver project ideal for practising Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) algorithms. Another solver version has been added that creates a .gif image showing the path to the solution using BFS algorithm. The great advantage of the algorithm used is effectiveness - it will always find a path to the solution if there is one, but it's also clear to see its gigantic drawback - slowness, as the more paths potentially leading to the solution, the more time the algorithm needs to find it. In the future I plan to add the solver using other pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra).
