#Maze-Generator-And-Solver

A simple maze generator and solver project great for practising Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) algorithms. The maze generator uses DFS as its better at tangling things up. Then, maze solver is fed the maze to solve and it does it using BFS algorithm - the great advantage of BFS is effectiveness - it will always find a path to the solution if there is one, but it's also clear to see its gigantic drawback - slowness, as the more paths potentially leading to the solution, the more time the algorithm needs to find it. In second version of the script the other solver version has been added that creates a .gif image showing the path to the solution. In the future I plan to add the solver using other pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra).
